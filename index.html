				<h2>Welcome</h2>
				<p>The Zombie Hour is (or ... aehmm... will be) a
				strategic, multiplayer,  zombie killing,  role playing game.</p>
				<p>The Game will be divided into Scenarios which typically last between
				60 and 120 minutes.</p>
				<p>(When it's ready...): Create a character, join a scenario, and start killing them
				Zombers</p>
				<h2>Progress/Updates</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>Characters die when killed.</li>

					<li>Scenario spawn points work.</li>
					<li>Player leaderboard is up.</li>

				<h2>What I need to do before you can play...</h2>
				<p>Woohoo!  You can actually play it now, but these are
				some things I'm currently working on/thinking
				about.</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Opening and closing doors.</li>
					<li>Breaking windows and doors.</li>
				</ul>
				<p>If I have a game server currently running you can
				access it <a href="/game">here</a>, and if not, you can
				always call me or something and I could start the
				server up.</p>
