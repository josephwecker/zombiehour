So for the rails app I want it to include any and all "shops", "training
grounds", logins, character saves, character customizations, stories, and maybe
some other things as well.
So what would the basis of it be?

User Pages:
	Login/Account Setup
	Listing of Characters
	Status Page
So what does a user need?  A login name, and password, and maybe that's all.
Then they have many characters.

Character Pages:
	Status Page
	Location Page

Maybe I should have it so that you can only buy things from where you currently
are located, so if you want to buy something new you have to find your way
there first, or "have access" to it already.  So you go from your character
location page to the shop, and not be able to directly go to the shop.
Con:  People can't check out the shops unless they have an account, and it
shouldn't be hidden like that...
